- 👋 Hi, it's Camila 👩🏻‍💻 a Professional procrastinator-turned-developer. 
- When I'm not putting off work, I'm 🪄 casting spells to bring code to life. 
- English and Spanish, and French. 
- I believe that coding is an art 🎨, and like any good artist 🎭, I'm always seeking new ways to improve my craft. So when I'm not slinging code, you can find me tinkering with new ideas 💡, participating in hackathons 👩🏻‍💻, and collaborating with other developers to bring our dreams to life.
- Let's create something amazing 🌟 together and bring some much-needed fun to the world of coding 🎉!
